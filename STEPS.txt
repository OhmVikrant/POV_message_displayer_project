Step 1: Materials
	
1. (1) Arduino Uno
2. (3) 74HC595N shift resistors
3. (24) Blue LEDs
4. (24) 220 ohm resistors
5. (1) 27 cm diameter ring
6. (1) piece of threaded rod L:36cm dia:7.5mm
7. (1) Ebike MY6812 120W 12V 3350rpm DC Motor
8. (1) Flexible coupling OD:25mm*L:32mm Bore:8mm*8mm	
9. (1) Ball bearing 8mm dia


Step 2: Building the ring

1. We bought an aluminium strip of width 3.5cm and thickness 3mm and beat that strip to make a circular one with diameter
   27 cm approx.
2. We drilled two holes of diameter 8mm on top and bottom of the frame. Then we drilled 29 more holes of diameter 3mm on the strip for the 
   affixation of the LEDs, 24 on one side and 5 on the other.
  
Refer to img_1 in the folder images.


Step 3: Making the circuit

We made the circuit as given in the blog on breadboard first, checked it and then replicated the same on a copper board(we
soldered the shift resistors and the wire connections within. After checking the connections this time, we made the pcb in eagle software and ordered the pcb from India Circuit. But 
due to delay in delivery, we used the circuit on the copper perf board for affixing to the frame as described in the 
following section.


Step 4: Putting it all together

1. We passed the rod through the frame and fixed it using four nuts.

2. We soldered the LEDs with the resistors and passed those LEDs into the holes of the circular from inside. We used glue
   for fixing the LEDs as well as for preventing the positive terminal from being short or grounded.

3. Now the perf board is fixed on the rod using extensive taping. Connections are made between the ICs and the LEDs. And 
   the Arduino is also fixed on the other side of the rod whose connections are made with the IC(primary) and the 5 LEDs.

4. Bottom side of the rod is welded with a metal piece of exact dimensions that gets fitted into the motor coupler which 
   is fixed with the motor. 

5. Top side of the rod is welded with a metal piece with dimensions that fit with ball bearing in use.

6. We fix a circular cardboard of the size of the frame on the side of the perf board. Refer to img_2



Step 5: Making the Clamp

1. The rpm of the motor is too high and the vibrations are pretty large. So we make a double L shaped steel piece and 
   fix it to a wooden base which already has a hole through which the motor goes in and gets fixed tightly. Refer to img_3.

2. For handling the vibrations we set the whole thing onto a cardboard box with dry soil filled in it.


Step-6: Code..........................

See the file 'Code' and also check the readme.md file thoroughly.






****REFER  to  img_(4,5,6) at the end. Here we make only a few blue LEDs blink and all the red ones glow.
